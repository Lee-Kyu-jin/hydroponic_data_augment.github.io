The need for big data analysis and artificial intelligence for smart agriculture is continuously requested. 
It is essential to collect and label large amounts of quality data for artificial intelligence research, 
but there is a relative lack of data in the hydroponic cultivation area. 

It is hard to open original data set to public. 
But, here are two argumented datasets from original data set 
and it's useful for experiment in the hydroponic cultivation area.

1. Anti-caner leaf lettuce dataset by DCGAN
2. Anti-caner leaf lettuce dataset by Stable Diffusion

You can use these data sets to develop ML model for growth detection
or to improve the performance of ML model.

For example, ML Model learning and testing was conducted using DCGAN data only. 
As a result, the accuracy of ResNet was 61.2, DenseNet was 62.4.
And model performance improvement experiment was proceeded by adding augmented data to the original data. 
As a result, the accuracy of ResNet increase from 86.5 to 88.2 and DenseNet from 92.9 to 94.7.
